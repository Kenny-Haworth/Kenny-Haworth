## Who am I?

My name is Kenny, and I'm a software engineer with 4 years of professional experience. Here on GitHub I have projects,
games, and tools I've worked on for myself and others. My favorite language is Java and I love making clean
and efficient code. I am a quick learner and I am always eager to work with new technologies and frameworks.
